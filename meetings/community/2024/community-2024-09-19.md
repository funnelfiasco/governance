* Is writing the SQL for the REST queries easy for what you want to do, Marco?
    * Marco: Things had been based on 0.3, now we’re trying to keep up with latest GUAC. I have been adapting all of that. I’ve been trying to upstream fixes as quickly as possible. Regarding the queries, I’ve rewritten them all to work with the new data model. There’s a lot of stuff going on. Updating GUAC is part of making the product more reliable.
    * Marco: With the new data model, the queries are easier and better. The good news is that Ent supported everything I had to do.
