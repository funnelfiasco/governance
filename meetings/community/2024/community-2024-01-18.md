    * Persistent, can handle large inputs and well tested
    * Having issues with utilizing pubsub with document blobs since they all have limited size, using gocloud library to abstract it away for blob store.
        * Folks have asked can we use other pubsub besides NATS like kafka (gocloud can allow this flexibility)
    * Doing something  akin to case study with an end user as an acceptable criteria for 1.0
